                <p>Dear #Coronavirus,<br />
                    <br />
                    Since your arrival, I am grateful as you have already showed me these three things:<br />
                    <br />
                    1. You've got us to reassess our priorities.<br />
                    As I was lying in bed while the whole city feels like Ghost town, I was thinking what is it that
                    I
                    really want to do with my life if money didn't mean shit!<br />
                    <br />
                    2. You have changed how we humans value things.<br />
                    All in a sudden, the remote rice field that I own, where I rarely visit feels like the only real
                    safe haven on earth!<br />
                    <br />
                    3. You have revealed our true colours.<br />
                    As fear and anxiety has taken over, we have seen both the best and worst sides of our people.
                    What
                    this means is when you depart, we will be able to say here are the ones we would like to keep ,
                    and
                    here are the ones we are no longer afraid to let go.<br />
                    <br />
                    Thank you #Coronavirus.<br />
